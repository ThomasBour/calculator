# My horrible calculator

- Solo project html/css made by Thomas Bourgeois
- Date : 16/11/2020
- Deadline : 18/11/2020 19h00

## Mission 

-We had to create a calculator using only (mostly) javascript to consolidate our basis
-We had to generate a calculator layout with a display on top and all the digits buttons (0 to 9), the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `x`, `/`), a button to calculate the result (`=`) and a button to clear the display (`C`)

### Inspiration

We had to get inspiration from [google calculator](https://www.google.com/search?q=calculator), which I've taken a look at. And i've also used one of mine for the design.
